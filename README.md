# 🏏 BPL-DREAM 11

## 📋 Project Description

BPL-DREAM 11 allows users to choose cricket players within a coin-based budget. The application mimics a fantasy league system, enabling the selection of players, toggling views between available and selected lists, and ensuring logical constraints such as no duplicates and team size limits. The interface is designed to match the provided Figma UI and ensures a seamless user experience.
